    ">\n",
    ">After reading over problem 3. I would only add that n is taken implicitly to be the max integer provided in the list `nums`. For example if the intention was to list `[0,1,2,...,21,22,23]` and the we were provided `nums=[1,4,7]` alone then given the inputs of the function as such that would be impossible to perform. This point clarifies explicitly that we aren't given `params(nums=[1,4,7],target=23)` and left to find the list `[0,2,3,5,6,8,9,10,...,22,23]`. No, we are just given `nums` and the target`n` is understood to be `n=max(nums)=7` with `return [0,2,3,5,6]`\n"
